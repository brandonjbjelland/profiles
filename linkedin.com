## Summary

I help organizations deliver high-quality software efficiently by taking radical ownership, empowering peers, and leveraging modern practices. As a hands-on technical leader, I work across the organizational spectrum—advising on strategy, engaging stakeholders, and tackling the toughest engineering challenges. I believe the best results come from connecting people, technologies, and ideas.

Organizational archaeology, a laser-focus on business problems, and a light touch are my sharpest tools for steering departments toward happiness, sustainability, and high performance.

I’m adaptive but generally biased toward…

•	Doing over analyzing: I dive in to produce minimum viable products, gaining domain understanding while aiming for production-quality deliverables.
•	Showing over telling: A demo speaks volumes.
•	People over technology: I focus on pragmatic solutions and long-term ownership, advising based on the business and team needs rather than the flashiest tech.
•	Communicating in multiple mediums: Code, talks, docs, diagrams, and presentations — ideas are only as impactful as they are effectively communicated.
